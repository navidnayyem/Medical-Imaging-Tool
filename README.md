# Project 1: Medical Imaging Tool

## Overview

This project involves designing a Neural Network to classify healthy and non-healthy (with Tuberculosis (TB) manifestations) chest X-rays. The model is designed to differentiate between TB and No-TB cases.

## Project Details

- **Data**: Chest X-ray images, including TB and normal X-rays.
- **Neural Network**: The model includes multiple hidden layers to enhance classification accuracy.
- **Binary Decision**: The network is trained to classify images as either TB or No-TB.
- **Train/Test Split**: The dataset is split into 80% for training and 20% for testing.
- **Implementation**: The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
